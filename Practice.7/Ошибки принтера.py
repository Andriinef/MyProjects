""" n a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which,
    for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.
    The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be
    aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time
    color a...
    Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g.
    aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.
    You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string
    representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string.
    Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.
    The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.
